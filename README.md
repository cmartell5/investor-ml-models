Comparing the Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest Classifier

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing loans on a secondary market. I will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I will be comparing the Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Steps Taken for Project:
- Retrieve the data from a csv file. Import the data using Pandas and put into a dataframe.
- Split the Data into Trnaing and Testing Sets.
- Create, Fit and Compare Models:
  - Create a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score.
  - Create a Random Forest Classifier, fit it to the data, and print the model's score.
  
Prediciton prior to starting project on which model works better for this type of data: My prediction is that the Logistic Regression model will be more accurate, since this is what many banks currently use to do credit scoring for customer loans.
